            <h2>About NIDPS (Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System)</h2>

            <div class="top">
                <div class="top-left">

                    <p>This system is designed to monitor live network traffic in real time, detect potential intrusions or anomalies using machine learning, and proactively block malicious IP addresses to protect the system.</p>
            
                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-time packet capture using PyShark</li>
                        <li>Machine learning-based classification (Decision Tree)</li>
                        <li>Automatic and manual IP blocking</li>
                        <li>Live dashboard visualization with Flask + Socket.IO</li>
                        <li>Blocked IP logging and Supabase integration for data storage</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python (Flask, Scikit-learn, PyShark)</li>
                        <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)</li>
                        <li>Flask-Socket.IO for real-time updates</li>
                        <li>Supabase for cloud-based database storage</li>
                        <li>Linux Firewall (iptables / UFW)</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>The NIDPS continuously listens to network traffic on a selected interface. Each packet is analyzed and classified as either Normal or Anomalous using a pre-trained Decision Tree model. If a source IP sends too many anomaly packets, the system blocks it automatically. All blocked IPs and their metadata are stored in a remote Supabase database, and admins can manage them through this dashboard.</p>
            
                    <h3>Intended Use</h3>
                    <p>This system is intended for educational, research, and small-scale network security environments. It can be deployed on Linux-based virtual machines or servers to enhance security visibility and automate early-stage intrusion response.</p>
            
                    <h3>Developed By</h3>
                    <p>Designed and developed as part of a Final Year Project by Rahul, under the guidance of Miss. Jane Ferris, TU Dublin.</p>
            
                    <p><em>This dashboard is part of a real-time intrusion detection system. All data is processed locally and securely.</em></p>
